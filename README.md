### Todo

There is a `UserTable` component which includes a small form to add a new user to a table of users.

There is one issue: There are NO tests!!!

Add tests using `@testing-library` and make sure the coverage is met by running `npm run coverage`

There is a file `main.yml` which has the basic definition for running tests in a Github pipeline. Either fork this repo OR create your own repo and use this `yml` file to ensure your tests are passing as expected when a user pushes a commit to the `master` branch.

Make the `main.yml` file your own! Perphaps you want to run tests on other branches as well or... whatever!

### Testing

Add tests using `@testing-library` and make sure the coverage threshold is met by running

`npm run coverage`
